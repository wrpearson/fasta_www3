<h2>Searches with PSI-BLAST PSSM's</h2>
<p>
The FASTA <b>SSEARCH</b> and <b>PRSS</b> programs can use the
Smith-Waterman algorithm to compare a BLAST Position Specific Scoring
Matrix (Altschul, et al, 1997 <A
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=Citation&list_uids=9254694">[Entrez]</a>)
to a sequence database (<b>SSEARCH</b>) or evaluate the statistical
significance of a PSSM:sequence alignment using <b>PRSS</b>.  Searches
and shuffles using <b>SSEARCH</B> or <b>PRSS</b> use both a query
sequence and an encoded <b>Position Specific Scoring Matrix</b>
(PSSM).
<p>
Checking the option: <b>Use PSSM:</b> <input type=checkbox></input><br>
presents an option uploading an ASN.1 PSSM file you have saved.
<! --  or downloading PSI-BLAST RID file. -->
<p>
PSSMs can be obtained either with (1) the <A href="chaps.cgi"
target=chaps>CHAPS</a> program, which takes a set of sequences, aligns
them with Clustal (), and then produces a PSSM using PSI-BLAST, or (2)
directly from the NCBI PSI-BLAST program after a search.  PSSM files
saved from <A href="chaps.cgi" target=chaps>CHAPS</a> can be uploaded
using the:
<hr>
Upload PSSM ASN.1 file<br>
<input type="file" name="msa_asn_file"></input>
<br>
<hr>
option that appears
when <b>SSEARCH</b> or <b>PRSS</b> is selected as the comparison
program.  If you upload a PSSM ASN.1 file, you must be certain that
you use the first sequence in the multiple alignment as the query
sequence - the <b>SSEARCH</b> and <b>PRSS</b> programs detect
differences between the query sequence and the sequences in the PSSM,
and will report an error if they differ.
<p>
PSSM's are also available from
NCBI's <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi"
target=blast>PSI-BLAST WWW site</a>.  After you have performed <b>two or more</b>
iterations of a PSI-BLAST search, you can evaluate the statistical
significance of the expectation value estimates from the last
iteration by downloading the NCBI PSSM (the link is currently at the
top/center in the <tt>Download</tt> menu, you need
the <tt>PssmWithParameters ASN.1</tt>.  Currently, this file will only
work if you have uploaded or pasted a FASTA sequence file in the box.
It does not work if only an Accession number was provided.
<p>
Download the <tt>PssmWithParameter</tt> file, and upload using:
<hr>
Upload PSSM ASN.1 file<br>
<input type="file" name="msa_asn_file"></input>
<br>
<hr>
<!--
<hr />
Get PSSM from NCBI Blast RID:<br>
<input type="text" name="msa_asn_rid" size=25></input>
<br>
<hr />
-->
Once again, the query sequence used for the search or shuffle must
match the first sequence used in the PSI-BLAST search.
