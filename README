This package of perl scripts implements the current FASTA WWW site.

The scripts are:

fasta_www.cgi	- the main program that listens for commands
FASTA_WWW.pm	- the CGI::Application perl module that provides the
		  functions that implement the different commands
		 (run-modes)
tmp_gs.cgi	- a script for converting post-script to png or pdf 
		  for images


select.tmpl	- template files for the different "forms" that
compare.tmpl	  the user to select the program, sequence, library
misc1.tmpl	  (or second sequence) and parameters


fawww_defs.pl	- a machine-specific configuration file that specifies
		  where programs and databases are found
fawww_libs.pl	- configuration file that lists programs and database
		   selections
fawww_pgms.pl	- configuration file for do_form() and search3() options
fawww_pgm_text.pl - text descritions for menu pages

Perl CPAN modules used:

File::Temp	- create temporary files for compare 2 sequences, shuffles
CGI::Application - central to the entire system
CGI::Session	 - allows status of searches to be tracked
CGI::Application::Plugin::Session   - required with CGI::Session
IPC::Run	- used for running programs, capturing stdout, stderr
IO::Scalar	- reading from strings
HTTP::Request	 - for remote searching
HTML::Template
HTML::Entities	 - prevent cross-site scripting
HTML::FillInForm	- helps preserve arguments
LWP::UserAgent	- required for remote searching in a cluster
LWP::Simple	- used to get sequences from NCBI
Text::ParseWords - re-encode command line argument
JSON            - save/transmit parameters as JSON

Helper programs required:

ghostview (gs)	- required for plots of local alignments (plalign) and
		  of Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy.  Used by tmp_png.cgi,
		  and fasta_www.cgi rm=misc1 pgm=pkd to convert ps to
		  PDF and PNG (tmp_png.cgi)

fastacmd	- used to get sequences locally when they are available.
		  fastacmd can read a local copy of the NCBI nr
		  protein library.  The code has not been tested with
		  local DNA nt library.  Other helper files:

Other files required:

fast_libs.www	- a FASTLIBS file (see FASTA documentation) that lists
		  the databases available: their names and locations
fast_gnms.www	- a FASTLIBS for genome databases
