The inference of homology relies on the observation that unrelated
protein sequences have similarity score distributions that are
indistinguishable from "random" sequences. PRSS aligns two protein
sequences, and then estimates the statistical significance of of the
alignment score by sshuffling the second sequence 200-1000 times and
examining the distribution of shuffled sequence scores to estimate the
lamda and K parameters of the extreme value distribution.
